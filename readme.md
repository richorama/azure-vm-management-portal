# Azure VM Management Portal

A cut-down portal for non-technical users to create, start, stop and delete Virtual Machine instances.

Perfect for your training or sales teams to create and tear down machines, without having access to the whole Azure Portal.

Run in Azure Websites.

Uses Azure Active Directory to authenticate users, so you can synchronize it with your local domain.
